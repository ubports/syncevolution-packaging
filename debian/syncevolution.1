.SH OPTIONS
\fB\-\-sync\fR|\-s <mode>
\fB\-\-sync\fR|\-s ?
.IP
Temporarily synchronize the active sources in that mode. Useful
for a "refresh\-from\-server" or "refresh\-from\-client" sync which
clears all data at one end and copies all items from the other.
.PP
\fB\-\-print\-servers\fR
.IP
Prints the names of all configured servers to stdout.
.PP
\fB\-\-print\-config\fR|\-p
.IP
Prints the complete configuration for the selected server
to stdout, including up\-to\-date comments for all properties. The
format is the normal .ini format with source configurations in
different sections introduced with [<source>] lines. Can be combined
with \fB\-\-sync\-property\fR and \fB\-\-source\-property\fR to modify the configuration
on\-the\-fly. When one or more sources are listed after the <server>
name on the command line, then only the configs of those sources are
printed. Using \fB\-\-quiet\fR suppresses the comments for each property.
When setting a \fB\-\-template\fR, then the reference configuration for
that server is printed instead of an existing configuration.
.PP
\fB\-\-print\-sessions\fR
.IP
Prints a list of all previous log directories. Unless \fB\-\-quiet\fR is used, each
file name is followed by the original sync report.
.PP
\-\-configure|\-c
.IP
Modify the configuration files for the selected server. If no such
configuration exists, then a new one is created using one of the
template configurations (see \fB\-\-template\fR option). When creating
a new configuration only the active sources will be set to active
in the new configuration, i.e. "syncevolution \fB\-c\fR scheduleworld addressbook"
followed by "syncevolution scheduleworld" will only synchronize the
address book. The other sources are created in a disabled state.
When modifying an existing configuration and sources are specified,
then the source properties of only those sources are modified.
.PP
\fB\-\-migrate\fR
.IP
In SyncEvolution <= 0.7 a different layout of configuration files
was used. Using \fB\-\-migrate\fR will automatically migrate to the new
layout and rename the old directory $HOME/.sync4j/evolution/<server>
into $HOME/.sync4j/evolution/<server>.old to prevent accidental use
of the old configuration. WARNING: old SyncEvolution releases cannot
use the new configuration!
The switch can also be used to migrate a configuration in the current
configuration directory: this preserves all property values, discards
obsolete properties and sets all comments exactly as if the configuration
had been created from scratch. WARNING: custom comments in the
configuration are not preserved.
\fB\-\-migrate\fR implies \fB\-\-configure\fR and can be combined with modifying
properties.
.PP
\fB\-\-restore\fR
.IP
Restores the data of the selected sources to the state from before or after the
selected synchronization. The synchronization is selected via its log directory
(see \fB\-\-print\-sessions\fR). Other directories can also be given as long as
they contain database dumps in the format created by SyncEvolution.
The output includes information about the changes made during the
restore, both in terms of item changes and content changes (which is
not always the same, see manual for details). This output can be suppressed
with \fB\-\-quiet\fR.
In combination with \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR, the changes to local data are only simulated.
This can be used to check that \fB\-\-restore\fR will not remove valuable information.
.PP
\fB\-\-remove\fR
.IP
This removes only the configuration files and related meta information.
If other files were added to the config directory of the server, then
those and the directory will not be removed. Log directories will also
not be removed.
.PP
\fB\-\-sync\-property\fR|\-y <property>=<value>
\fB\-\-sync\-property\fR|\-y ?
\fB\-\-sync\-property\fR|\-y <property>=?
.IP
Overrides a configuration property in the <server>/config.ini file
for the current synchronization run or permanently when \fB\-\-configure\fR
is used to update the configuration. Can be used multiple times.
Specifying an unused property will trigger an error message.
.PP
\fB\-\-source\-property\fR|\-z <property>=<value>
\fB\-\-source\-property\fR|\-z ?
\fB\-\-source\-property\fR|\-z <property>=?
.IP
Same as \fB\-\-sync\-option\fR, but applies to the configuration of all active
sources. "\-\-sync <mode>" is a shortcut for "\-\-source\-option sync=<mode>".
.PP
\fB\-\-template\fR|\-l <server name>|default|?
.IP
Can be used to select from one of the built\-in default configurations
for known SyncML servers. Defaults to the <server> name, so \fB\-\-template\fR
only has to be specified when creating multiple different configurations
for the same server. "default" is an alias for "scheduleworld" and can be
used as the starting point for servers which do not have a built\-in
configuration.
Each template contains a pseudo\-random device ID. Therefore setting the
"deviceId" sync property is only necessary when manually recreating a
configuration or when a more descriptive name is desired.
.PP
\fB\-\-status\fR|\-t
.IP
The changes made to local data since the last synchronization are
shown without starting a new one. This can be used to see in advance
whether the local data needs to be synchronized with the server.
.PP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR|\-q
.IP
Suppresses most of the normal output during a synchronization. The
log file still contains all the information.
.PP
\fB\-\-help\fR|\-h
.IP
Prints usage information.
.PP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Prints the SyncEvolution version.
